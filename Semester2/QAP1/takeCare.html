        <h2 class="heading">Food/Diet</h2>
        <p class="format">
          Determining your Betta fish's diet can be difficult. There are many
          brands and varieties of Betta fish food available, but of course some
          of them are low-quality and not best suitable for your fish. Some
          <strong>live foods</strong> is some of the healthiest way to feed
          you're Betta fish. The most popular live foods include brine shrimp,
          mosquito larvae, and bloodworms. Although, watching your Betta fish
          eat something live can be exicting, this can put you at risk of
          bringing parasites into your tank; just try not to feed him anything
          you find outside.
          <br />
          <br />
          If your Betta fish doesn't like live food or you just like other
          options you can go with
          <strong>Betta fish flakes or pellets.</strong> Important to note, that
          your betta fish are <strong>carnivores</strong> that need a very high
          protein diet. Fish flakes and pellets is the most common way to feed
          your fish, so when buying make sure it is specifically meant for betta
          fish, has high protein and other nutrients that helps the fish thrive.
          Also, feeding your fish the same thing for forever can sertily keep
          them alive, but just like us they want a wide range of food to be
          healthy.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Frozen food</strong> is also a good option, just like live
          food, but the foods i mentioned frozen, this example is more safe then
          live food. So, I would recommend experimenting with different food
          types for best results.

      <h2 class="heading">Water Quality</h2>
      <p class="format">
        Betta fish in their history could tolerate harsh water conditions, but
        keeping your fish healthy by not catching an illness, you should think
        otherwise. Betta's prefer calm water and because they are a tropical
        fish, they need the water temperature to be warm. If you're room
        temperature isn't in the tropics, a tank heater is a great alternative.
        The tank's water which is best for their health is between 76° and 85°F.
        Be advised the size of the heater according to how big your tank is; a
        mini heater for small containers and so on. Also, clean your tanks!
