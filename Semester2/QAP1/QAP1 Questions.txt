1) Hm, I'm not too sure about the exact amount of time, but lets just say 5 hours everyday. So, starting on friday everyday, but not every day. 
Today on tuesday I probably was doing it for 2 hours, apply fonts, touching it up and stuff and I put the audio in then. Also, the side panel took 
me awhile like 2 hours to do, from watching a vidio and looking at W3Schools and I done the side panel the first day and then the next day we went 
over something like that. This took me long because it is my first time doing something like this, I would play with alot of things, I was ahead of 
myself on this one because we didn't need to make a website like I did, but I did it anyways and I still have stuff I want to do with it.

2) I used my notes from your lectures, W3Schools, MDN Web Docs and YouTube videos of course.

3) I didn't need to ask anyone anything.

4) I had no questions surprisingly.

5) Um, it got better over time, when I was doing the side panel, that was hard to me, when we didn't go over something like that. I'd say the difficulty
metor for me was about 5.5/10, wasn't too hard and it was fun because I just got a Betta fish and researching about him was great. Yes, I do feel confident 
that I can conquer different problems coming up.
