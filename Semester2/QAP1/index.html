        <h2 class="heading">About Betta Fishes</h2>
        <p class="format">
          The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siamese_fighting_fish">Siamese fighting fish</a> or most
          notably known as the Betta fish is a beautiful fish. Although, these
          fish are cruel in nature, they can make a lovely friend as a pet. The
          name <strong>Siamese fighting fish</strong> is the creature's
          scientific name, this name was givin' because Betta fish fight other
          Betta fish. However, only male Betta fish fight each other, they do
          this to establish a territory because they want everything to
          themselves, food, shelter, whatever they want. So, recommending a cute
          roomate for him will be a difficult task, yet if they have proper
          health and plenty of room to move around, this is possible. On the
          other hand, where the name <strong>Betta</strong> came from was from
          an ancient warrior tribe in Thailand. In fact, they thought of these
          fish as <strong>"warrior fish"</strong>, thus spawning a so called
          sport where the fishes fight. Rather then betting on who is the last
          fish standing, spectators would actually bet on what fish was more
          brave. What a history for a cute little tropical fish, huh?
        </p>

        <p class="format">
          The Betta was first discovered in Southeast Asia and the fish begin
          it's popularity in the mid-1800s. The harsh conditions of Thailand,
          the fish didn't really find a suitable home; making their homes in
          ditches, flood plains, etc. Constant flooding from storms and other
          natural occurrences, made the fishes move from place to place more
          often. The Betta's adapted and became more accustomed to these
          conditions, thus becoming a
          <strong>labyrith fish</strong>. What is a Labrith fish? These fishes
          have the ability to breathe with their gills, just like mostly every
          fish, but they possess a unique abilty to breathe oxygen. Following
          this, Betta fish can inhale the air, but they can only do this for
          short periods of time, this helped them tremendously thoughout their
          existence. Though, these "beutiful warriors" (was another name given
          to these fish in the 1800s) could tolerate these conditions, they still
          like clean water quality. With appropriate water changes and proper
          water temperature beacuese these fish are also tropical fish (more
          information on how to take care of Betta fishes via the side panel,
          "Taking Care of Betta Fishes").

          These pets are fairly common, one of the most popular pet fish today,
          but some are quite more rare then others. With around 73 known
          recognized species as of today, each fish is unique by their species
          type with a wide range of colors and fin types (the most notable types
          can be accessed via the side panel, "Types of Betta Fishes", for more
          information).

        <ul id="facts">
          <li>Most Betta fish live for 2 - 3 years.</li>
          <li>
            During times of betta fish breeding, male Betta's build a bubble nest
            at the surface to attract a female. That's if you ever wondered why
            they make bubbles at the top of your tank.
          </li>
          <li>
            The correct way to pronounce Betta is not like what mostly everyone
            says it is, "bay-tuh". It is actually pronouced "bet-tah"
            originating from the ancient warrior tribe talked about.
