      <h2 class="mainHeading">Tail Types</h2>
      <p class="format">
        One of the most defining way to classify your Betta fish is by the shape
        of their tails. There are many variations of the Betta's tail and all
        examples of these beautiful tails are listed below, as
        well as their color types are as listed. Some colours are rarer then
        others, Betta's range from all colours of the rainbow, so it's hard to
        list them all. Males and Females also have small differentiating
        looks, for example males generally have longer fins while females have
        shorter fins. There are hundreds of different Betta fish.

          They lack webbing between the rays on the fins. The webbing stops well
          short of the peaks, giving a spikey appearance.
