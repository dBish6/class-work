# Full-Stack_Sprint2_Final
This is my final sprint project from Semester 3 2022 in my Solfware Development Course at Keyin Collage. My group members were Dominic Whelan, Chris Doucette and Blake Waddleton.
The propose of this project was to show our understanding of an REST API and using CRUD with Postgres and MongoDb.

- npm install
- npm run server

Running Tests:
- npm test
- npm test -- m.auth.dal.test.js
- npm test -- p.search.dal.test.js
- npm test -- routes.test.js

Event Emitters:
The events format is as follows; dataTime, id, message, and level.

Events save to the logs folder:
- searchLog.log

Please read the Database Instructions.doc for how to set up the Postgres database and the MongoDb cluster for running our web application.
