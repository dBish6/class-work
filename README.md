These are the assignments that were done in my Software Development course at Keyin College to showcase my journey and my progress. I am a graduate and definitely now have a good understanding of software from this course. If you take a look, what you would really want to see is our sprint assignments, those we're graded like exams basically. The school year was from __Sep 2021 to Dec 2022__.
