1) It didn't take me very long to complete this assignment sense this is only the basic SQL stuff. It took me three days, the first day I was at it 
longer becasue I was looking at examples and the postgres tutorial site, so around 5 hours. The next day was around 4 hours, that day was me just
trying to figure out joins somewhat and now today doing the questions, like 15 mins or something, not long.

2) I used postgresqltutorial.com, W3Schools and watched a video on INNER JOINS.

3) Nope, didn't need to ask friends.

4) Nope, no questions.

5) All the questions was fairly easy like 2/10, but the join question was harder like 3.5/10, it just took me a bit to wrap my head around it completely.
I know that the joins is a pretty big topic and we should definitely look more into that, which I know we will. Yes, I do feel confident I can complete
problems like this, but this is a whole new thing to us, but in the future I can see this not going to be as hard as other languages.
