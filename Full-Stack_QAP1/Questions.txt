1) How many hours did it take for me to complete this assessment? Not very long, I'm sorry but I didn't keep track of each individual part.. but I can
    tell you the total. Overall, I started friday and was at it till supper, that's what I usually do, so 5 hours that day. Also, I'm not just doing the assignment in
    that amount of time, I was like at these modules thinking what ones i'm going to do, reading about them and I watched a video, etc. So, say 3 hours
    actually on the assessment that day. Saturday I was at it all day, getting of track looking other things that has to do with it, you know. So, that day was 
    around 6 hours just dilly dolling around and getting the whole thing done that day. Now it's Sunday and I'm finished for what I have to do. Today I just 
    was looking at it touching it up, like 1 hour today.

2) Online resources I used was W3Schools, code from class and some of my code, Node.js documentation, this cool Node.js Learn on the documentation 
     site and YouTube.

3) Nope didn't need to ask anything to friends.

4) I did ask Peter about using require.js with an HTML page, that's when I was getting off track, getting ahead of myself and was going to make
    a working clock with moment.js and display it on an HTML page. I just ended up making the clock in the console, I know we'll hopfully learn how 
    to do that.

5) This was a very easy assignment, I'd say 2/10 difficulty for me. I do feel confident with using Node in the future.
